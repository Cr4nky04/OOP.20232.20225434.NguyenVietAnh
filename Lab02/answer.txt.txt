Q1: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Yes, in Java, you can create multiple constructors for a class, each with a different set of parameters. This feature is called constructor overloading. Constructor overloading allows you to instantiate objects in different ways, depending on the parameters provided.

Q2: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

In Java, when you pass objects to a method, you're passing references to those objects, not the actual objects themselves. This means that when you swap objects within a method, you're only swapping the references, not the original objects. As a result, changes made to the references within the method won't affect the original objects outside the method.

Q3: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

Because the method changeTitle takes a DVD object and a new title, then sets the new title for the given DVD (jungleDVD). After that, it directly modifies the "title" attribute of the jungleDVD by new title. So the title of the JungleDVD changed.
