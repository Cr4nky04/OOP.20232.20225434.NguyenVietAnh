Some comparison betwwen AWT and Swing in Java:

1. Top-level Containers:
-AWT: AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit. It is a platform-dependent API to develop GUI
(Graphical User Interface) or window-based applications in Java1.
-Swing: Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) that is used to create
various applications. Swing has platform-independent components1.
2. Class Names of Components:
-AWT: The AWT Component classes are provided by the java.awt package2.
-Swing: The Swing component classes are provided by the javax.swing package2.
3. Event-Handling:
-AWT: AWT is based on a peer-based architecture, utilizing native platform components3.
-Swing: Swing follows a lightweight architecture with its own set of components3.
4.Appearance of Applications:
-AWT: The appearance of AWT Components is mainly not configurable.
It generally depends on the operating systemâ€™s look and feel2.
-Swing: The Swing Components are configurable and mainly support pluggable look and feel2.

In summary, while both AWT and Swing can be used to develop GUI applications in Java,
they have significant differences in their top-level containers, class names of components,
event-handling, and the resulting appearances of the applications developed using them.
Swing, being a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC), is lightweight and provides more
functionalities compared to AWT1. It also supports a pluggable look and feel, which makes
the applications developed using Swing have a platform-independent appearance2.
