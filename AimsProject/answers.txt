The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods
are called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?

When exceptions generated by the play() methods in the AIMS application are not caught and handled, several potential issues can arise:
-Application Crash: Uncaught exceptions can cause the entire application to crash. This is particularly disruptive for users, as it can result in loss of work and a poor user experience.
-Unclear Error Messages: Without catching and properly handling exceptions, users might see generic error messages that do not provide any useful information about what went wrong or how to fix it. This can lead to confusion and frustration.
-Security Risks: Unhandled exceptions can sometimes expose sensitive information about the application's internal state, which can be exploited by malicious users.
-Resource Leaks: If exceptions are not caught, resources such as files or network connections might not be properly closed or released, leading to resource leaks and potential application instability over time.
-Inconsistent State: The application might be left in an inconsistent state if exceptions are not handled properly. This can cause further errors and unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.
