1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?

The class representing the items in the cart should implement the Comparable interface.
By doing so, we enable the natural ordering of these items based on specific criteria.

2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo () method to reflect the ordering that we want?

The compareTo() method should be overridden in the class implementing Comparable.
It should return:
A positive integer if the current object is greater than the parameter object.
A negative integer if the current object is less than the parameter object.
Zero if the current object is equal to the parameter object.
The compareTo() method defines the natural comparison order for the objects.

3. Can we have two ordering rules for the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?

No, the Comparable interface allows only one natural ordering.
If you need multiple ordering rules (e.g., by title and then by cost), consider using a custom comparator (not the Comparable interface).

4. Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost.
How would you modify your code to allow this?

To accommodate different ordering rules for DVDs and other media types:
Create a separate class (e.g., MediaItem) that implements Comparable.
In the compareTo() method, apply the specific rules for DVDs (title, decreasing length, and cost).
For other media types, apply the desired rules (e.g., title and cost).
When sorting the cart items, use different comparators based on the media type.
